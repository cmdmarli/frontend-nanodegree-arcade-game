# Classic Arcade Game Clone project

Third project from the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree in Udacity: recreated the classic arcade game Frogger with Object-Oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

## How to run the game

Download the repository in your desktop, unzip it and open the "index.html" file in your browser to play the game.

## How to play the game 

To play the game, use the arrow keys from your keyboard to move your player up, right, down and left.

You should avoid the bugs (enemies). The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once you, the player, collides with an enemy, the game will start over.

Once you reache the water the game is won!
